# Charles Neal's Portfolio

## [Project 1: Car Price Predictor](https://github.com/charlesbneal2/Predicting_Car_Prices)
- Created a tool that estimates market prices (RMSE ~$2600) for cars based on technical specs to help people negotiate great deals on cars
- Built the tool on 205 car listings from the 1985 Ward's Automotive Yearbook hosted on the UCI Machine Learning repository
- Implemented a kNN Regressor and tuned hyperparameters to find the optimal model

## [Project 2: House Sale Price Predictor](https://github.com/charlesbneal2/Predicting_House_Prices)
- Created a tool that estimates house sale prices (RMSE ~$27,000) to help people negotiate selling or buying a home
- Built the tool on house sale data compiled from Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. The data were published by Dean De Cock in the Journal of Statistics Education
- Implemented a multivariate linear regression model with k-fold cross validation

## [Project 3: Predicting Bike Rentals](https://github.com/charlesbneal2/Predicting_Bike_Rentals)
- Implemented and compared three models to predict number of bike rentals in a given hour: Linear Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor
- With 14 numeric features and simple holdout validation, determined that Random Forest Regressor was the best model with lowest root mean squared error (~45 bikes)

## [Project 4: Handwritten Digit Classifier](https://github.com/charlesbneal2/Handwritten_Digits_Classifier)
- Compared KNN and neural network models to predict handwritten digits from UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Optimized parameters for each model to find best performance. Both models converged near 98% accuracy, with the KNN model performing slightly better.
